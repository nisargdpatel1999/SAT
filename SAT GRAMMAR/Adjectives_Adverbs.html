	<h1 id="Adjectives_Adverbs" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons</u></h1>
	<p>Adjectives are used to modify nouns and pronouns, while adverbs are used to modify verbs and adjectives. Adverbs commonly, but not always, end in "ly." On the SAT and ACT, it is wise to always determine what word an underlines adjective or adverb is describing so you can determine whether it is being used correctly.</p>
	<p><strong>Correct: </strong>The girl is quick.<br>The adjective "quick" is used to modify the noun "girl."<br><strong>Correct: </strong>The girl ran quickly.<br>The adverb "quickly" is used to modify the verb "ran."<br><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The girl ran quick.<br>It is incorrect to use the adjective "quick" to modify the verb "ran."</p>
	<p><strong>Correct: </strong>The girl is fast.<br>In this example, "fast" is used as an adjective to modify the noun "girl."<br><strong>Correct: </strong>The girl ran fast.<br>In this example, "fast" is used as an adverb to modify the verb "ran."</p>
	<p><strong>Correct: </strong>He was silently happy.<br>The adverb "silently" is used to modify the adjective "happy."<br><strong>Incorrect: </strong>He was silent happy.<br>It is incorrect to use the adjective "silent" to modify the verb "happy."</p>
	<h2 style="color:black">Comparative Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>
	<p>For comparative adjectives and adverbs, use the comparative (more, less, -er) when comparing two and the superlative (most, least, -est) when comparing three or more. When deciding whether to precede an adjective or adverb with "more" or end it with an "er" to make it comparative, use your ear. If both options sound good, end it with "er." Only when the ending "er" sounds bad should you precede it with "more" to make it comparative. For instances, "intelligenter" clearly sounds wrong, so you are forced to choose "more intelligent" instead. The same applies to most/est.</p>
	<p><strong>Correct: </strong>The girl is quicker than her sister.<br>
		The comparative adjective "quicker" is comparing the nound "girl" and "sister."<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The girl is the quickest person on her soccer team.<br>
		The superlative adjective "quickest" is comparing more than two people: the girl and everyone else on her team.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The girl runs more quickly than her sister.<br>
		The comparative adver "more quickly" compares how the girl and her sister run.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The girl runs the most quickly of anyone on her soccer team.<br>
		The superlative adverb "most quickly" compares how the girl runs to how everybody else on her team runs.<br>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The girl runs the quickest of anyone on her soccer team.<br>
		The adjective "quickest" cannot by used to compare how the girl runs with how everybody else on her team runs. Instead, the sentence must feature the adverb "most quickly."</p>

	<h2 style="color:black">Less vs. Fewer</h2>
	<p>The adjectives "less" and "fewer" can be particularly tricky. "Less" is used to compare things that cannor be counted, cna "fewer" is used to compare things that can be counted.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>There is less milk in the carton than there was before I drank a glass.<br>
		The amount of milk in a carton cannot be counted (although it can be measured), so "less" is appropriate.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>There are fewer cans of soda in the fridge than there were before I drank one.<br>
		The number of cans of soda in the fridge can be counted, so "fewer" is appropriate.
	</p>

	<h2 style="color:black">Compare Like to Like</h2>
	<p>	
		It is important when making a comparison like to like.<br>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The Steakhouse's portions are much larger than most restaurants in town.<br>
		It is unlikely that the portions at The Steakhouse, as large as they might be, could be larger than an entire restaurant. It does not make sense to compare portions to restaurants.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The Steakhouse's portions are much larger than those of most restaurants in town.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The Steakhouse's portions are much larger than the portions of most restaurants in town.

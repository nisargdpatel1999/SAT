   <h1 id="Pronoun Agreement" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Pronoun Agreement</u></h1>
   <p>A pronoun must agree with its antecedent, the word it renames. In other words, singular pronouns must rename singular nouns and plural pronouns must rename plural nouns. Any time a pronoun is underlines, match it with its antecedent to make sure they agree.</p>
   <p>If you match a pronoun with its antecedent and are not sure if the antecedent is singular or plural, use the is/are test: if the antecedent sounds good followed by "is," it is singular, and if it sounds good followed by "are," it is plural. Be particularly careful with the pronoun "they," as "they" is commonly misused as a singular pronoun in spoken English.</p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Any students who needs extra help with their homework should see their teacher after class.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Any student who needs extra help with his or her homework should see his or her teacher after class.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>All students who needs extra help with their homework should see their teachers after class.<br>
   	"Any student" is singular, so it cannot be renamed by "their." Either the antecedent or the pronoun must be changed to create agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The football team made the playoffs for the first time in years. Hopefully, they can win the championship.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>The football team made the playoffs for the first time in years. Hopefully, it can win the championship.<br>
   	This one is tricky, since "they" in the incorrect version refers to "the football team," which is made up of many players. However, the football team is technically a singular entity, which you can tell because "the football team is" sounds a lot better than "the football team are." Because it is singular, it must be replaced with a singular pronoun.
   </p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The zebra mussel is not native to the North America, but they now thrive in North America's Great Lakes.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>The zebra mussel is not native to North America, but it now thrives in North America's Great Lakes.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Zebra mussels are not native to North America, but they now thrive in North America's Great Lakes.<br>
   	The incorrect version incorrectly switches from a singular to a plural construction. The plural "they" cannot rename the singular "zebra mussel" even if "the zebra mussel" is referring to the entire species. It is not what you are talking about that is important; it is how you are talking about it. Whether a sentence uses a singular or plural construction, it must stay consistent.<br>
   </p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Each of the brothers did well on their math finals.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Each of the brothers did well on his math final.<br>
   	This one is tricky, since "their" in the incorrect version appears to renaming "brothers," which is plural. However, it is actually incorrectly renaming "each," which is singular. "Each" is the true one-word antecedent of the pronoun in this example, and "of the brothers" is simply a phrase that modifies "each." When dealing with agreement, the relevant word that must be agreed with can never under any circumstances be found within a phrase. In particular, beware of phrases that begin with the preposition "of." It is alwo wise to remember that "each," "either," "neither," and "none" are singular words.
   </p>
   
   <h2 style="color:black"><strong>Vague Pronoun</strong></h2>
   <p>When you are matching a pronoun with its antecedent to check for agreement, check to make sure that there is in fact a clear and recent antecedent. A pronoun must refer to and agree with a specific antecedent, not something that is understood but not specifically mentioned. The antecedent must also be recent. How recent it must be depends upon the context and the potential for ambiguity. If there is the slightest bit of ambiguity as to who or what a pronoun could be referring to, use a noun. Recognize that you are being tested on this concept when one or more answer choices give you the option of using a noun instead of a pronoun. When you are given this potion on the ACT, the noun is correct a high percentage of the time.</p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Although he must have been tired after working for 12 hours straight, he didn't let it show.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Although he must have been tired after working for 12 hours straight, he didn't let his tiredness show.<br>
   	This one is tricky, because although it is fairly obvious in the incorrect version that "it" refers to his tiredness, "tiredness" is never stated in the sentence, so "it" lacks a clear antecedent.
   </p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>I have worked hard to make these sentences clear. This should make it easier for you to learn about pronouns.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>I have worked hard to make these sentences clear. The clarity of these sentences should make it easier for you to learn about pronouns.<br>
   	Watch out for the word "this," as it often lacks a clear antecedent.
   </p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Mark dislikes Chris because he is a better athlete.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Mark dislikes Chris because Chris is a better athlete.<br>
   	In this incorrect version, it is unclear who is the better athlete.

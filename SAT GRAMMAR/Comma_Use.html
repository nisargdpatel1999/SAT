	<h1 id="Comma_Use" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Comma Use</u></h1>
	<ol>
		<li style="color:black"><strong>To separate the items in a list.</strong></li>
		<p>
			<strong>Example: </strong>I like watching football, baseball, and basketball.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>I mowed the lawn, went grocery shopping, and made dinner.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>The quarterback threw the ball, the receiver caught it, and the cornerback failed to tackle him.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>The favorite snack foods are pretzels, chips and salsa, and peanuts. (Not that there is no comma between "chips and salsa" because "chips and salsa" counts as a single item in the list.)
		</p>
		<li style="color:black"><strong>Along with a conjuntion to separate two independent clauses.</strong></li>
		<p>
			<strong>Example: </strong>The boy threw the ball, and he watched it fly.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>I tried to play the violin, but it sounded terrible.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>The boy threw the ball and watched it fly.<br>
			The above sentence does not have a comma because the part after the "and" is not an independent clause.
		</p>
		<li style="color:black"><strong>To separate phrases and dependent clauses from the beginning of an independent clauses.</strong></li>
		<p>
			There are no exceptions to this rule, except in the case of some very short introductiory phrases for which case the comma is optional. Most one-word introductions to sentence, such as "therefore," "thus," and "however" must be followed by a comma.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example: </strong>Because he was tired, he took a nap.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>On the table, there was a book.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>In Chicago, it is often windly.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>Although I like ice cream, I do not like frozen yogurt.<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream. However, I do not like frozen yogurt.
		</p>
		<p><strong>When phrases and dependent clauses are added to the end of a sentence, no comma is typically used.</strong></p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example: </strong>He took a nap because he as tired<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>There was a book on the table<br>
			<strong>Example: </strong>It is oftwn windy in Chicago<br>
		</p>
		<p>There are exceptions to this rule in which a comma is used to separate a phrase or dependent clause from the end of an independent clause. Use your ear to figure out when these exceptions occur. If your ear is on the fence, though, assume no comma.</p>
		<p><strong>Example: </strong>He comes from Canada, a country known for its cold weather.</p>
		<li style="color:black"><strong>Two commas are used to separate non-essential phrases from the middle of a sentence. If a phrase is essential, it should not be separated from the rest of the sentence by commas.</strong></li>
		<p>
			<strong>Example: </strong>The Yankees, who play in New York, are always a tough team to beat.<br>The phrase "who play in New York" is non-essential, since the rest of the sentence would work just fine without it. If the phrase were removed, the sentence would still be perfectly clear and would not lose more than the phrase itself.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Example: </strong>People who live in New York expect their baseball team to win.<br>In this example, "who live in New York" is essential, since the meaning of the sentence would change drastically  if the phrase were removed from the sentence. Without "who live in New York," the subject of the sentence would simply be "people," and the sentence would imply that all people expect their team to win, which is not the intended meaning of the sentence. (I am from Cleveland, so I never expect my team to win.) Whenever a phrase is needed in order to specify or clarify the subject of a sentence, it is essential and therefore requires no commas to separate it from the rest of the sentence.</p>
		<p><strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream. I do not, however, like frozen yogurt.<br>In this example, "however" is non-essential, so it must have a comma before it and a comma after it.</p>
		<li style="color:black"><strong>Commas are sometimes used to separate two adjectives that are describing the same noun.</strong></li>
		<p>Use your ear to decide whether to use a comma in this situation.</p>
		<p><strong>Example: </strong>The tall, snowy mountain towered over the village.<br>A comma separates the adjectives "tall" and "snowy."</p>
		<p><strong>Example: </strong>The Boy Scout helped the little old lady cross the street.<br>No comma separates the adjectives "little" and "old."</p>
		<p>Although your ear should be pretty effective in deciding whether to use a comma between two adjectives, the difference can be explained technically in terms of the roles of the adjectives. If two adjectives of relatively equal importance both independently modify the noun, a comma should be used. For instance, in the first example, "tall" and "snowy" both independently modify "mountain." On the other hand, if the first adjective modifies the nound which has already been modified by the second adjective, a comma should not be used. In the second example, it is more accurate to say that "little" modifies "old lady" than that "little" and "old" both independently modify "lady," so no comma is used.</p>
	</ol>
	<p style="color:black"><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Once you learn the rules, consider any decision to use a comma in terms of the rules. You must have a rule-based reason to use a comma rather than a reason not to.</li>
		<li>One specific situation in which students oftwn incorrectly use a comma is between a subject and its verb. NEVER put comma between a subject and its verb, even when your ear tells you to put one in. It is particularly tempting to put a comma between a subject and its verb when the subject is long and/or non-concrete. For instance, in the following sentence, many students would be tempted to incorrectly put a comma between "skiing" and "is." "The best part about skiing is that you get to go fast."</li>
		<li>When deciding whether a comma should be used, consider all the commas in the sentence and strive to understand the structure of the sentence as a whole.</li>

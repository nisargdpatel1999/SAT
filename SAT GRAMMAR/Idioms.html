	<h1 id="Idioms" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Idioms</u></h1>
	<h2 style="color:black"><strong><u>Idiomatic Language</u></strong></h2>
	<p>Idiomatic language involves the use of certain expression that are said a certain way for no specific grammatical reason. Typically, there is no logical justification of why a certain word is correct in an idiomatic expression; it just is.</p>
	<p>Idiomatic language is the reason why a direct translation of something written in a foreign language often does not make sense, since idioms cannot be conveyed through direct translation. Common sayings or figures of speech fit into the category of idiomatic langauge. For instance, to say somebody "lost his marbles" does not mean that he literally lost his marbles; it means that he went crazy. This type of idiomatic language is only occasionally featured on the SAT or ACT. The tests more frequently test students on the proper preposition to use in an expression. Prepositions are words like by, for, on, of, to, at, and after. Preposition use inn expressions is almost always an issue of idiomatic language, since there is usually no logical reason to use one preposition over another. On the SAT, idomatic preposition use is most frequently tested on Identifying Sentence Error questions, but it can appear on any of the three sections. On these questions, closely examine any underlined preposition, and use your ear to make sure it is the proper preposition for the expression. On the other sections of the SAT and on the ACT, take note of situations in which you are given the option of different prepositions. To figure out which preposition is appropriate in an expression, use your ear. Think about how you have heard the expression before, and maybe even make up your own sentence featuring the expression to see how you would say it.</p>
	<p><strong>Below are some examples of correct idiomatic expressions.</strong></p>

	<ol>
		<li>by accident</li>
		<li>on purpose</li>
		<li>intended to "This page is intended to teach you about idiomatic language."</li>
		<li>intended for "This email is intended for your eyes only"</li>
		<li>look at "I looked at the clock."</li>
		<li>look for "I looked for my keys."</li>
		<li>points at "I pointed at the car."</li>
		<li>points to "The evidence points to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty."</li>
		<li>in danger</li>
		<li>in agreement</li>
		<li>on sale "The book is on sale." (This means it is being sold at a discount.)</li>
		<li>for sale "The book is for sale." (This means it is being sold.)</li>
		<li>on fire</li>
		<li>young at heart</li>
		<li>modeled by "This model car was modeled by me." (This means that i put the model together.)</li>
		<li>modeled on "This model car is modeled on a Ferrari Testarossa." (Just as in the above example, this means that it is a replica of a Ferrari Testarossa)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In the above list, many of the expression differ only in the preposition used. As you can see, many words can take more than one preposition but have different meanings according to which preposition is used. Be especially careful of such words on the SAT or ACT. If you are using your own sentence in an attempt to figure out an idiomatic expression, make certain that the expression in your sentence is being used in the same way as the expression in the question.</p>

	<p style="color:black"s><strong><u>Misplaced Modifiers</u></strong></p>
	<p>A modifier is a word or phrase that modifies, or describes, something. Modifiers must be placed next to whatever they are modifying or describing.</p>
	<p>If you notice (on the ACT or SAT Improving Sentence questions that different answer choices are giving you different options for the placement of an adjective or adverb, choose the option that places it next to what it is describing.</p>
	<p><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The cloudless airplane flew through the sky.</p>
	<p><strong>Correct: </strong>The airplane flew through the cloudless sky.<br>When the modifier in the question is simply an adjective or an adverb, misplaced modifier issues are fairly easy to recognize just by using your ear, as is the case in the above example.</p>
	<p>Misplaced modifiers can be much more difficult to catch just by using your ear when the modifier is a phrase.</p>
	<p><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Surrounded by strangers, a feeling of uneasiness swept over Ryan.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>Surrounded by strangers, Ryan began to feel uneasy.<br>In this example, "surrounded by strangers" is a modifying phrase, so it must be followed by whatever it is most specifically describing, which is Ryan, not "a feeling of uneasiness."
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Skiing down the mountain, John's hat flew off his head.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>Skiing down the mountain, John felt his hat fly off his head.<br>
		In the example, the incorrect version is sneaky, because "John" appears come right after the modifying phrase. However, "John's hat" is not the same as "John," and John's hat is not skiing down the mountain. Watch out, as the subtle form of misplaced modifier appears frequently on both the SAT and the ACT.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>She showed up with her boyfriend wearing a pink dress.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>She showed up wearing a pink dress with her boyfriend.<br>
		In this example, the incorrect version implies that her boyfriend was wearing a pink dress.
	</p>

	<p>Misplaced modifiers can be tricky to catch using only your ear, since they don't always sound obviously wrong. To make sure you don't get fooled by a misplaced modifier, you have to know where to look for them. Whenever a sentence begins with a phrase, and then you are given different options for how to begin the independent clause that follows the phrase, you must recognize that you are bring tested on a misplaced modifier. Then, it's easy. Just put whatever the phrase is talking about right after the phrase. Misplaced modifiers also show up frequently on "awkwardness questions," questions in which you must choose the least awkward option. Misplaced modifiers are frequently responsible for a sentence sounding just a bit off. Before you choose an answer on an awkwardness question, make certain that it does not contain any subtle misplaced modifiers. Misplaced modifiers are one of the most common errors on SAT Improving Sentences questions.</p>
	
	<h2 style="color:black"><strong><u>Parallel Construction</u></strong></h2>
	<p>Parallel construction dictates that the items in a list or comparison must be expressed in as similar a manner as possible. The items in a list or comparison should all be nouns or all be verbs, and if the items are verbs, they should all be expressed in the same tense.</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>I like spaghetti, hamburgers, and eating pizza.<br>
		"Spaghetti" and "hamburgers" are both nouns, while "eating pizza" is a verb.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>I like spaghetti, hamburgers, and pizza.<br>
		Every item in this list is a noun.
		<strong>Correct: </strong>I like eating spaghetti, hamburgers, and pizza.<br>
		When "eating" comes before the first item in the list, it applies to every item in the list.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>I read books, watch TV, and listening to music.<br>
		Although this list consists only of verbs, "listening to music" is not in the same tense as the other two verbs.
		<strong>Correct: </strong>I read books, watch TV, and listen to music.<br>
		Every item in this list is a verb that is in the same tense.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>I like to ski better than snowboarding.<br>
		"To ski" and "snowboarding" should not be compared because they are in different tenses.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>I like to ski better than to snowboard.<br>
		The comparison can be made between the infinitive of both verbs.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>I like skiing better than snowboarding.<br>
		The comparison can be made between the present participles of both verbs.

   <h1 id="Verbs" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Verbs</u></h1>
   <h2 style="color:black">Verb Agreement</h2>

   <p>A verb must agree with its simple subject. Any time a verb is underlined, match it with its subject to check for agreement.</p>
   <p>If you match a verb with its subject and are nto sure if the subject is singular or plural, use is/are test: if the subject sounds good followed by "is," it is singular, and if the subject sounds good followed by "are," it is plural. Then, if you are having trouble figuring out the singular or plural form of the verb, use the he/htey test. The singular form of the verb will sound good preceded by "he" and the plural form of the verb will sound good preceded by "they."</p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The leaves on the tree was starting to turn yellow.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>The leaves on the tree were starting to turn yellow.<br>
   	Here, the verb must agree with "leaves," not "tree." This example features one of the SAT and ACT's favorute ways of tricking students on verb agreement questions: putting a phrase that ends in a singular word ("on the tree") in between a plural subject and what needs to be a plural verb (or vice versa). It is important to remember that your simple subject can never be found within a phrase.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Sarah and Nancy plays softball.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Sarah and Nancy play softball.<br>
   	Although "Sarah" and "Nancy" are each singular individually, "Sarah and Nancy" is a plural and therefore requires the plural "play." If a subject contains more than one item connect with "and," it is plural.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The lion or the tiger are the most impressive big cat.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>The lion or the tiger is the most impressive big cat.<br>
   	When "or" is used to connect two singular subjects, a singular verb is used. When "or" is used to connect two plural subjects, a plural verb is used. When "or" is used to connect a singular and a plural subject, the verb should agree with whichever subject it is closest to.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Neither of the mice were able to get to the cheese.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Neither of the mice was able to get to the cheese.<br>
   	This one is tricky, since the plural word "mice" might appear to be the simple subject of the sentence, in which case the plural "were" would be appropriate. However, the subject is actually "neither," which is singular, and "of the mice" is simply a phrase that modifies "neither." WHen dealing with agreement, the relevant word that must be agreed with can never under any circumstances be found within a phrase. In particular, beware of phrases that begin with the preposition "of." It is also wise to remember that each, either, and neither are singular words. You should also be aware that when an indefinite pronoun (either, neither, each, any, all, some, few, somebody, most, etc.) is the first word of a sentence, it is probably the subject of the sentence even though it derives most of its meaning from a modifying phrase.
   </p>

   <h2 style="color:black">Verb Tense</h2>

   <p>Whenever a verb is underlined, you should make sure it is in the correct tense. It is unnecessary to learn the name of every tense. Just be able to match like with like and use the context to figure out the proper tense of a verb. Look at the tense of any other verbs in the sentence and (on the ACT and on SAT Improving Paragraphs questions) in nearby sentences. A verb will most likely be in the same tense as the other nearby verbs unless there is a reason to shift the tense. If you suspect a shift in the time frame being discussed based on the context, you likely need to shift the verb tense. Be sure to also consider <u>parallel construction</u> when considering verb tense; the verbs in a list or comparison must be written in the same tense.</p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Yesterday, I went swimming and play basketball.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Yesterday, I went swimming and played basketball.<br>
   	It is obvious based on the context that both verbs in the sentence occured in the past, so the past tense is needed.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Right now I am a student, but someday I become a doctor.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Right now I am a student, but someday I will become a doctor.<br>
   	Although the verbs within a sentence are usually written in the same tense, here the context of the sentence dictates that the first verbs is in the present tense and the second verb is in the future tense.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>She brushed her teeth, read book, and goes to bed.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>She brushed her teeth, read a book, and went to bed.<br>
   	Parallel construction dictates that every verb in a list should be expressed in the same tense. Furthermore, there is simply no reason to shift from the past to the present tense in the sentence.
   </p>

   <h2 style="color:black">Recognizing Past Participles</h2>

   <p>One of the trickiest verb tense errors on the SAT and ACT involves the part participles of verbs. A past participle of a verb is the form of verb that can be preceded by "had" or "have" (among other uses). The past participle of a verb is often identical to the past simple (the regular past tense); when thesetenses are not the same, they are often confused. Below are some examples.</p>

   <table border="1" width="100%" style="color:black">
   	<thead>
   		<tr>
   			<th><strong>Past Simple</strong></th>
   			<th><strong>Past Participle</strong></th>
   		</tr>
   	</thead>
   	<tbody>
   		<tr>
   			<td>did</td>
   			<td>done</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Played</td>
   			<td>Played</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Was</td>
   			<td>Been</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Beat</td>
   			<td>Beaten</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Came</td>
   			<td>Come</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Gave</td>
   			<td>Given</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Swam</td>
   			<td>Swum</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Began</td>
   			<td>Begun</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Forgot</td>
   			<td>Forgotten</td>
   		</tr>
   		<tr>
   			<td>Cleaned</td>
   			<td>Cleaned</td>
   		</tr>
   	</tbody>
   </table>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>He begun to eat.<br>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>He has began to eat.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>He began to eat.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>He has begun to eat.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>He should have begun to eat.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Incorrect: </strong>I have forgot your name.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>I have forgotten your name.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>I would have forgotten your name.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>I forgot your name.<br>
   	One final note on verb tense: generally avoid answers that contain the word "being," as "being" is used in many more incorrect answers than correct answers on both the SAT and the ACT. Be certain you are right before choosing an answer that contains the word "being."

   <h1 id="Pronoun Case" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Pronoun Case</u></h1>
   <p>Pronoun case refers to the use of subject pronouns (like "she") in the subjects of sentences and object pronouns (like "her") in the objects of sentences. Usually, pronoun case is intuitive for native English speakers. For instance, you would never say "Her did well on the test" or "I sent an email to she." The two pronouns for which case can be trieky is I/me and who/whom.</p>
   <h2 style="color:black"><strong>I/me</strong></h2>
   <p>I = Subject</p>
   <p>Me = Object</p>
   <p>In other words, if the I/me is performing the action described by the verb (is the subject of the verb), the proper word is "I." If the I/me is not the subject of a verb, the proper word is "me." One good way of figuring out if "I" or "me" makes sense is to remove the other person from the sentence, as situations involving another person are where people most frequently misuse "I" or "me." For instance, if a sentence said "My father and ______ watched football," the proper word is "I," since the sentence would read "I watched football," not "Me watched football" if "my father" was removed from the sentence. If the sentence said "My brother watched football with my fatehr and ______," the proper word is "me" since the sentence would read "My brother watched football with me," not "my brother watched football with I." Certain types of sentences limit your ability to use this test by requiring more than one person in order to make sense. FOr instance, if a sentence said "There has always been a sibling rivalry between my brother and ______," the sentence would make no sense if you were to remove "my brother." A goot test in this situation is to rewrite the sentence in the third person: "There has always been a sibling rivalry between his brother and him." Because you would use the object pronoun "him," you should use the object pronoun "me."</p>
   <h2 style="color:black"><strong>Who/whom</strong></h2>
   <p>Who = Subject</p>
   <p>Whom = Object</p>
   <p>In other words, if the who/whom is performing the action described by the verb (is the subject of the verb), the proper word is "who." If the I/me is not the subject of a verb, the proper word is "whom." If you have trouble thinking about it simply in terms of subject vs. object, refer to the following test:</p>
   <p>Whom: Is preceded by a preposition OR is followed by a noun or pronoun.</p>
   <p>Who: Is not preceded by a preposition AND is followed by a verb.</p>
   <p>The best way to use a test is in two steps. First, determine if the who/whom is preceded by a preposition. Prepositions are words such as to, for, from, at, by, and of. If the who/whom is preceded by a preposition, "whom" is the correct word. If the who/whom is not preceded by a preposition, you must move on to the second step, which is to see what the who/whom is followed by. If it is followed by a verb, "who" is the correct word, since it is the subject of the verb. If it is followed by a noun or pronoun, "whom" is the correct example, since the noun or pronoun after it is the subject of the sentence's verb. Note that the verb or the noun or pronoun is not always the very next word after the who/whom. It is a matter of what you get to first after the who/whom: a verb or a noun or pronoun.</p>
   <h2 style="color:black"><strong>Below are several correct examples of who and whom:</strong></h2>
   <ol>
   	<li>That is the person who kicked the ball to me</li>
   	<li>That is the person to whom I kicked the ball</li>
   	<li>That is the person whom I kicked</li>
   	<li>Michael Jordon, whome many people consider the greatest basketball player of all time, won six championships with the Bulls.</li>
   	<li>Michael Jordon, who won six championships with the bulls, is widely considered the greatest basketball player of all time.</li>
   	<li>To whom did you send that letter?</li>
   	<li>For whom is that persent?</li>
   </ol>
   <h2 style="color:black"><strong>Transition Words</strong></h2>
   <p>On the ACT and the Improving Paragraphs section of the SAT, you will sometimes be asked to choose the appropriate transition word. In these situations, it is important to consider the meaning of the ideas that the transition word is intended to link. Usually, the transition word, regardless fo its placement in a sentence, links the sentence to the previous independent clause.</p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream. However, I do not like frozen yogurt.<br>
   	<strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream; however, I do not like frozen yogurt.<br>
   	<strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream. I do not, however, like frozen yogurt.<br>
   	<strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream. I do not like frozen yogurt, however.<br>
   	<strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream, but I do not like frozen yogurt.<br>
   	In each of the above examples, the transition word, regardless of its placement, links the second independent clause to the first independent clause. "However" and "but" form appropriate transitions because they accurately portray the contradictory relationship between the two clauses.
   </p>
   <p>When the transition word is a dependent marker (a word that is added to the beginning of an independent clause to turn the independent clause into a dependent clause), it is linking the idea in the dependent clause to the independent clause it is attached to, whether the independent clause appears before or after the dependent clause.</p>
   <p>
   	<strong>Example: </strong>Although I like ice cream, I do not like frozen yogurt.<br>
   	<strong>Example: </strong>I like ice cream although, I do not like frozen yogurt.<br>
   	In each of the above exmaples, "although" links the dependent clause to the independent clause.
   </p>
   <p>When trying to determine the proper transition word to use, make sure you choose the one that most accurately describes the relationship between the two clauses it is linking. If none of the words accurately describes the relationship between the two clauses, choose not to use a transition word. Below is a list of the meanings of several common transition words.</p>

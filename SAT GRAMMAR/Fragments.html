	<p>Gragments are sentences that are incomplete and therefore cannot stand on their own. Every sentence must contain at least one independent clause, which by definition has a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. Students often associate fragments with being short, but this is not always the case. Some complete sentences can be extremely short while some fragments can be very long without ever expressing a complete thought. The SAT and ACT both like to test students on long fragments, since these fragments are more easily mistaken for complete sentences.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The blue house with yellow flowers in the front yard and a neatly trimmed lawn across the street from the baseball field.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The blue house with yellow flowers in the front yard and a neatly trimmed lawn sat across the street from the baseball fielf.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The blue house with yellow flowers in the front yeard and a neatly trimmed lawn across the street from the baseball field was built in 1908.<br>
		The incorrect version of this sentence does not contain a verb and therefore constitutes a fragment despite its length. Adding "sat" fixes the problem in the first correction. Adding "was built in 1908" fixes the problem in the second correction.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Playing the guitar every day for several hours.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>Playing the guitar every day for several hours is how you get good.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>Playing the guitar every day for several hourse, the boy dreamed of playing in a rock and roll band.<br>
		The incorrect version features no subject and is therefore a fragment. The first correction turns the original phrase into the subject of the sentence, while the second correction adds an independent clause to the end of the phrase.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Because I am tires of having to go to the practice every day after school.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>I am tired of having to go to practice every day after school.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>Because I am tired of having to go to practice every day after school, I am thinking about quitting the team.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>I am thinking about quitting the team because I am tired of having to go to practice every day after school.<br>
		The incorrect version features a dependent clause incorrectly standing alone, the most common form of fragment on the SAT and ACT. Although a dependent clause has a subject and a verb, it does not express a complete thought. The first correction fixes the fragment by dropping the "because" from the clause. Since "because" is a dependent marker that turns a clause into a dependent clause, dropping it from the clasue creates an independent clause, which is capable of standing on its own. The second correction fixes the fragment by adding an independent clause to the end of the dependent clause, and the third correction fixes the fragment by adding an independent clause to the beginning of the dependent clause.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>Many students, who worked hard to get into the colleges of their dreams.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>Many students worked hard to get into the colleges of their dreams.<br>
		The word "who" in the incorrect version turns the second part of the sentence into a phrase. Therefore, the incorrect version features a subject followed by a phrase and does not express a complete thought, since there is not verb ouside the phrase. By removing the comma and the word "who," the verb "worked" becomes the main verb of the sentence, turning the sentence into an independent clause that expresses a complete thought.

	<p>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The bird, soaring gracefully through the air high above the towering, snow-capped mountains.<br>
		<strong>Incorrect: </strong>The bird, having soared gracefully through the air high above the towering, snow-capped mountains.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong> The bird soared gracefully through the air high above the towering, snow-capped mountains.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The bird, soaring gracefully throught the air high above the towering, snow-capped mountains, spotted its prey on the valley floor far below.<br>
		<strong>Correct: </strong>The bird, having soared gracefully through the air high above the towering, snow-capped mountains, returned to earth and landed on a branch.<br>
		The two incorrect versions each feature a verb tense that results in the sentence failing to express a complete thought. Both verbs are simply part of a phrase, so neither sentence contains a main verb. In the first correction, the verb tense is changed to the past simple tense, which can successfully funtion as the main verb of the sentence. In each of the other two corrections, a main verb ("spotted" and "returned") is added after the phrase, allowing the sentence to express a complete thought.

   <h1 id="Redundancy" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Redundancy</u></h1>
   <h2 style="color:black">Unnecessary, Irrelevant, Redundant: Reasons to Delete</h2>

   <p>BOth the SAT and the ACT value conciseness. You must seek out and delete anything that could be considered unnexessary, irrelevant, or redundant. Because we commonly speak redundantly, you cannot expect unnecessary, irrelevant, or redundant language to sound incorrect. Therefore, you should rely on the structure of the question to tip you off to look for such language.</p>

   <h2 style="color:black">Redundancy is repetitive</h2>

   <p>
   	<strong>Redundant: </strong>It was chilly and cold outside.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>It was cold outside.<br>
   	Although chilly and cold are not perfect synonyms, they are close enough in meaning that they are redundant when used together. Choose the more accurate of the two. Usually you will only be given the choice of one or the other so you will not have to decide which one is more accurate.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Redundant: </strong>The police cop arrested the burglar.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>The cop arrested the burglar.<br>
   	You can refer to him a policeman or a cop, but it is redundant to call him a police cop.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Redundant: </strong>The stupid idiot.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>The idiot<br>
   	An idiot is by definition stupid. Never use an adjective to modify a noun that already by definition presupposes that adjective.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Redundant: </strong>Large in size<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Large<br>
   	Large by definition refers to size.
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Redundant: </strong>There was a blizzard outside, so he stayed in the house because of the snow.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>There was a blizzard outside, so he stayed in the house.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>He stayed in the house because of the snow.<br>
   	There is no need to state why he stayed in the houre more that once.
   </p>

   <h2 style="color:black">Unnecessary is not needed</h2>

   <p>Sometimes language isn't redundant, but it just isn't needed. Words that add no meaning should always be eliminated.</p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Unnecessary: </strong>He was tired for the particular reason that he had been working all day.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>He was tired because he had been working all day.<br>
   	"For the particular reason that" contains no more meaning that the single word "because."
   </p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Unnecessary: </strong>There must have been some sort of mistake<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>There must have been a mistake.<br>
   	"Some sort of" adds no meaning to the sentence.
   </p>

   <h2 style="color:black">Irrelevant is off topic.</h2>

   <p>Irrelevant information is not directly on topic. All information must help to advance the logical flow of the paragraph, provide a relevant example, or clarify something that might otherwise be unclear. It must be more than "kind of related" to the focus of the paragraph. Many times, information that is only "kind of related," is really going off on a tangent, digressing from the focus of the paragraph. Any such information must be deleted.</p>

   <p>
   	<strong>Irrelevant: </strong>Grizzly bears are dangerous animals, so people who hike in grizzly bear territory should take certain precautions. Other dangerous animals include lions and poisonous snakes. In grizzly bear territory, people should hike with bear spray and make plenty of noise to prevent startling a bear.<br>
   	<strong>Correct: </strong>Grizzly bears are dangerous animals, so people who hike in grizzly bear territory should take certain precautions. In grizzly bear territory, people should hike with bears spray or a large gun and make plenty of noise to prevent startling a bear.<br>
   	Although the sentence about other dangerous animals is kind of related to the first sentence, it is irrelevant to the focus of the paragraph as a whole, since it merely goes off a tangent.
   </p>

   <h2 style="color:black">ACT</h2>

   <p>On the ACT, there are two structures you should look out for. If you are given the option to "OMIT the underlined portion" or "DELETE the underlined portion," you must consider whether there is any chance the underlined portion could be considered unnecessary, irrelevant, or redundant. If so, choose to omit or delete. Remember that the omitor delete option is correct about half the time it is offered. Of course, that also means it is incorrect about half the time, so be carefully not to overplay this tendency. The second structure you should look out for is when one answer choice is shorter than the others. Consider what is not included in that answer choice that is included in the others. If this information could be considered unnecessary, irrelevant, or redundant, choose the shorter option.</p>

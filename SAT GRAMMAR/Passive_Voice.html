  <h1 id="Passive Voice" class="title" align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Passive Voice</u></h1>
  <p>The passive voice is a construction that turns the natural object of a sentence into the subject and the natural subject of the sentence into the object. Although it does not technically constitute a grammatical error, it is stylistically undesirable in most situations and should rarely be chosen over the active voice on the SAT and ACT.</p>

  <p>
  	<strong>Active: </strong>The boy caught the ball<br>
  	<strong>Passive: </strong>The ball was caught by the boy<br>
  	<strong>Passive: </strong>The ball was caught.
  </p>

  <p>
  	<strong>Active: </strong>The students heard the sound of birds chirping.<br>
  	<strong>Passive: </strong>The sound of birds chirping was heard by the students.
  </p>

  <p>
  	<strong>Active: </strong>The principal introduced the speaker.<br>
  	<strong>Passive: </strong>The speaker was introduced by the principal.
  </p>

  <p>There are, of course, situations in which it makes sense to use the passive voice: if you do not know the subject of your sentence, cannor adequately articulate the subject, or wish to deemphasize the subject. However, such reasons to use the passive voice are highly unlikely to come up on the SAT or ACT. In general, you should always choose the active voice over the passive voice if they both seem grammatically correct. The only somewhat common situation in which you should choose the passive voice over the active voice is if the passive voice construction is needed in order to avaoid misplaced modifier error, as is illustrated by the followeing example:</p>

  <p>
  	<strong>Active: </strong>Spiraling through the air, the boy caught the ball.<br>
  	<strong>Passive: </strong>Spiraling through the air, the ball was caught by the boy.<br>
  	Here, the active sentence features a misplaced modifier error, since "spiraling through the air" is meant to be describing the ball, not the boy. Therefore, "the ball" must come right after "spiraling through the air.
  </p>

  <p>There are two main situations in which you should be on the lookout for the passive voice on the SAT and the ACT. The first occurs on "awkwardness questions," on which you need to choose the least awkward answer. Look out for the passive voice on these questions, and eliminate answer choices in which you see it, unless of course the use of passive voice is needed in order to avoid a misplaced modifier. The second situation occurs when you have a question narrowed down to two answer choices and are having trouble choosing between them because they both sound correct. Very often, one is written in the passive voice and the other is written in the active voice. CHoose the active voice. Choose the active voice. On the SAT, use of the passive voice is found most frequently on Improving Sentence questions, ocassionally on Improving Paragraphs questions, and rarely if ever on Identifying Sentence Error questions.</p>
